# ðŸ“Š Customer Data Clustering with Kaggle Dataset

Welcome to the *CustomerDataClustering_KaggleDataset* repository! This repository showcases the full process of creating Clustering models based on a Kaggle Dataset. Throughout the project, different models such as KMeans, DBScan, and AHC were implemented to cluster customer data effectively. The topics covered in this repository include 'ahc', 'clustering', 'customerdataclustering-kaggle', 'data', 'data-analysis', 'data-science', 'dbscan', 'kaggle', 'kaggle-dataset', and 'kmeans'.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Content

In this repository, you will find a structured approach to customer data clustering, which involves preprocessing the data, creating different clustering models, evaluating their performance, and interpreting the results. The main focus is to extract valuable insights from the data and group customers based on their characteristics.

The repository contains the following key components:
- Data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the dataset for clustering.
- Implementation of KMeans clustering algorithm to group customers into distinct clusters.
- Utilization of DBScan algorithm to identify clusters of varying shapes and densities in the data.
- Application of AHC (Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering) to create a tree of clusters.

## ðŸŒŸ Acknowledgements

We would like to express our gratitude to the Kaggle community for providing the valuable dataset that enabled us to conduct this clustering analysis. The insights gained from this project have the potential to assist businesses in understanding their customer base better and tailoring their strategies accordingly.

Thank you for visiting the *CustomerDataClustering_KaggleDataset* repository! Feel free to explore the project files, run the clustering models, and share your feedback with us.

Happy Clustering! ðŸŽ‰
